	\section{Problem Definition}
	In June 2017, the \ac{OSU} chapter of the
	\ac{AIAA} will launch a rocket in the Mojave Desert.
	This rocket will ascend to one hundred thousand feet \ac{AGL}.
	Designing, building, and launching the rocket will require the
	collaboration and expertise of dozens of engineers from a variety
	of disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, computer, and
	software.
	
	While the rocket is in flight, the \ac{OSU} rocketry team
	must be able to receive, view, and store telemetry in real-time.
	Mission critical information that must be received by the ground
	station are latitude, longitude, and altitude. The latitude
	and longitude will aid in tracking and recovery of the rocket
	after flight. Real-time altitude readings will allow the rocket
	team to determine if the objective of one hundred thousand feet
	has been met even if recovery of the rocket is impossible.

	\section{Proposed Solution}
	
	\subsection{Desired Features}
	After the primary objectives outlined in the previous section
	are met, there are a number of additional optional features
	that have been requested by the rocketry team.
	Many of our clients are still new to the team, and the specific
	needs and wants may change as the project progresses.
	desired features may include, in no particular order:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The engineers would like to be able to record and view data
		from a number of different sensors, not just altitude,
		latitude, and longitude.
		
		\item The software package could present the data graphically.
		This could include line graphs, overlaying position data
		on maps, or more.
		
		\item The data could be made available 
		
		\item A configurable interface could allow team members
		to select the data that they want to view in real-time.
		
		\item Automatic uploading of data to a remote host.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	The Computer Science team is 
	working closely with the ECE team, we are considering having two servers 
	present at the ground station. One would exist as a web server, this would
	serve and display data about the rocket on a local Wi-Fi network. We will
	write customized software that retrieves data from an external source and
	formats it before making it available to the web server. The second server,
	or application server, is where that software will exist. This server will
	read data from the serial port and log it. Since the Rocket Team hopes to 
	use this software in future launches we plan on making it easy to install.
	In order to test the software created we will be using data collected from
	previous competitions that have been completed by OSU's Rocket Team. This is
	also how we will be able to display the working software before the actual
	launch in mid-June.
	
	\subsection{The Ground Station}
	
	The final software package must be stable and resistance to errors.
	Losing peak altitude data could cause the record of the team's
	achievement to be lost, and any error in the latitude
	and longitude records could severely hamper or derail
	the recovery of the rocket.
	
	\subsection{Launch Simulation}
	
	A feature that would be helpful to have but not necessary, is simulating a launch
	through the use of code. One example of this would be manually changing the rocket's 
	perceived altitude in order to test the detachment of the payload and release of the
	parachutes. This would help the Mechanical Engineers test to see if 
	the rocket preforms as expected. 
	
	\section{Performance Metrics}
	
	The successfulness of the project will measured by whether the data
	is successfully recorded and made accessible to the rocketry team
	on launch day. To ensure the software is ready for launch day,
	we will consider three primary performance metrics:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stability: the software should not crash or otherwise cease operation
		\item Robustness: the software should handle bad inputs gracefully
		\item Accuracy: the software should correctly report all telemetry
	\end{itemize}
	
	In order to meet these requirements, a comprehensive test plan will
	be written and executed. This plan will involve sending large amounts
	of random, recorded, and live data to the software and recording the results.
	The software will only be considered successful if it passes all of these
	tests with no errors.
