## Introduction

This introduction should be generic enough that we can reuse it for future presentations.

In June 2017, the OSU chapter of the AIAA will launch a rocket in the Mojave Desert.
The software team will develop the tracking software that receives telemetry from the rocket during its flight, logs, and 
displays the data in real-time for the entire OSU rocketry team.
This software must be flexible, robust, and accurate in order to ensure that the variety of 
engineers on the project all receive the data they need on launch day.
Collecting the telemetry in real-time will reduce the chances of a failure-to-recover 
by allowing the ground team to track the rocket during its flight.
The graphical display will make the telemetry instantly understandable to the OSU rocketry team without time-consuming analysis.
Logging the data will ensure that it is accessible for analysis at a later date.
This presentation will provide an status update of the project.
