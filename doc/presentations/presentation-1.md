Introduction

In June 2017, the OSU chapter of the AIAA will launch a rocket in the Mojave Desert.
The software team will develop the tracking software that receives telemetry from the rocket during its flight and 
displays the data in real-time for the entire OSU rocketry team.
This software must be flexible, robust, and accurate in order to ensure that the variety of 
engineers on the project all receive the data they need on launch data.
Collecting the telemetry in real-time will reduce the chances of a failure-to-recover by allowing the ground team to track the rocket during its flight.
The graphical display will make the telemetry instantly understandable without time-consuming analysis.
The presentation will provide an status update.
