	The \textit{Groundstation} software will collect telemetry from a rocket while it is in flight and graphically display the telemetry in real-time. Groundstation is made up several different components: collection of data, storage of data, interpolation of data, and 
	display of data.
	This document is a compilation of most of the documents that were created over the course of the project.

\section{Purpose and Goals}
	In June 2017, the \ac{OSU} chapter of the
	\ac{AIAA} will launch a rocket at Spaceport America.
	This rocket will ascend to one hundred thousand feet \ac{AGL}.
	Designing, building, and launching the rocket will require the
	collaboration and expertise of dozens of engineers from a variety
	of disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, computer, and
	software.
	
	Many rockets record data during the flight. This data may include
	altitude, latitude, longitude, and more.
	Latitude and longitude
	data is helpful for locating the rocket after it lands, but
	if the data is located on the rocket, then it is useless
	for this task.
	Altitude data will tell the rocketry team if we have
	met the objective of one hundred thousand feet, but if the rocket
	is damaged or cannot be located for any reason, then the record
	of this achievement may be lost.
	
	However, the chicken-and-egg problem of not being able to access
	the location data before the rocket is found may be avoided by sending
	telemetry from the rocket in real-time.
	Telemetry may be received wirelessly
	by the rocketry team while the rocket is in flight, giving them
	access to useful information such as the rocket's last known location
	and the highest altitude reached. This telemetry will aid in the
	rocket's recovery and provide a log of the rocket's flight even if
	recovery is impossible.




	\section{The client}
	The project was requested by Dr. Nancy Squires, who is a senior
	instructor of mechanical engineering at Oregon State University.
	In addition to being a senior instructor, Dr. Squires runs many
	of the rocketry capstone projects.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	\index{Purpose}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	This document will specify the requirements for the Groundstation (GS) software.
	It is intended for use by the OSU High-Altitude Rocketry Team.
	
	\index{Scope}
	\subsection{Scope}
	GS will gather telemetry from a rocket during flight.
	While the telemetry is being gathered, it will be logged and displayed graphically in real-time.
	This software will provide the following benefits to the users:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Real-time data will allow the rocket's location to be tracked during flight.
		Allowing this data to be accessed before recovery will aid in the recovery itself.
		\item The graphical display will make the data easy to interpret.
		\item Logging will allow the data to be analyzed at a later date.
		\item Altitude data will give evidence of whether the objective of one hundred thousand feet was met.
	\end{enumerate}	
			
	\index{Definitions}
	\subsection{Definitions}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\index{Accuracy}
		\item \textbf{Accuracy:} The absence of errors in the telemetry GS receives, logs, and displays.
		\index{Binary data}
		\item \textbf{Binary data:} Telemetry that represents one of two states, for example, ``stage 2 activated'' and
		``stage 2 not activated.''
		\index{Corruption}

		start and begin all normal functions in under five seconds.
		\index{Robustness}
		\item \textbf{Robustness:} In the event that GS receives data that is garbled or otherwise does adhere
		to the protocol, it must continue to receive and display data and not break the real-time requirement.
		\index{Storage}
		\item \textbf{Storage:} A device where data is logged.		
		\index{Telemetry}
		\item \textbf{Telemetry:} Data received from the rocket while the rocket is in flight.
		\index{Telemetry packet}

	\subsection{Overview}
	The rest of this document contains specific requirements about the functionality and constraints of GS. This includes
	the needs of the entire rocketry team, the physical constraints of the system, and the limitations of the launch site.
	
	\textit{Overall description} gives a high-level view of the functions of the software and describes any constraints.
	\textit{Specific requirements} gives a detailed list of requirements that were proposed by the OSU High-Altitude
	Rocketry Team and describes specific requirements and constraints.
		
	
	\section{Overall description}
	\index{Product perspective}
	\subsection{Product perspective}
	GS will receive data from a serial interface, via hardware and a protocol provided by the avionics team.
	Due to the launch site not having any connection to the Internet or mobile service, GS will not interact with
	any outside systems. 
	Additionally, GS will provide a software interface that allows users to view the telemetry,
	graphically, in real-time.
	\subsection{Product functions}
	GS provides two major functions while the rocket is in flight:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\index{Logging}
		\item Telemetry logging to non-volatile storage.
		\item Display of real-time graphical data. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{User characteristics}
	\index{Users}
	The users of this software will be limited to engineering students and advisors who are part of the OSU High-Altitude
	Rocketry Team.
	These users will be expected to be familiar with the software and the rocket launch.
	Because the software team works closely with the rest of the rocketry team on regular basis,
	any training necessary will be conducted in-person.
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
	\index{Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Because of the remote nature of launch sites, the software must operate without an Internet connection.
		\item The software must be as reliable as is reasonably possible, and additional features must not compromise the reliability.
		\item Groundstation will receive telemetry via a protocol that is to-be-determined by the avionics team.	
	\index{Browser}
	\index{Web browser}
	GS will support most modern desktop web browsers, including:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Chrome version 54 or higher.
			\item Edge version 14 or higher.
			\item Firefox version 49 or higher.
			\item Safari version 10 and or higher.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\end{itemize}

	\index{External interface requirements}
	\subsection{External interface requirements}
	\index{User interfaces}
	\subsubsection{User interfaces}
	Users will interact with GS by connecting via a web browser. The Raspberry Pi and other associated hardware,
	to be provided by the avionics team,
	will broadcast a wireless network that users will connect to and access GS through a web browser.
	From this page, users will be able to access the graphical display of the telemetry.
	
	\index{Hardware interfaces}
	\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
	GS will run on a Raspberry Pi broadcasting a wireless network. Users will connect to GS with their personal computers
	via the wireless network.

	Data is received from a serial interface using a protocol that will be determined by the avionics team.
	
	\index{System Features}
	\subsection{System Features}
	
	The stimulus for all specific requirements is receiving a telemetry packet. The specific responses to each telemetry packet are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GS will collect data from a serial interface using a yet-to-be-determined protocol designed by the High-Altitude Rocketry Team's avionics section.
		\item GS will log all telemetry in real-time to non-volatile storage so that it can be analyzed
		after the launch.
		The data from the serial port will be written to directly to non-volatile storage in order to limit
		the possibility of corruption.
		\item The graphical display shall be updated in real-time.
		\item Users will connect to GS and be able to view a visualzation of the telemetry in real-time.
		\item GS will support a live line graph visualization for altitude data.
		\item GS will have the ability to show the most recently recorded latitude and longitude in a numerical format.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\index{Performance requirements}
	\subsection{Performance requirements}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When a new telemetry packet is received, GS will log the telemetry and update all visualizations in under one second.
		\item GS will support a minimum of 20 concurrent users.
	\end{itemize}



	\subsection{Design constraints}
	\index{Design contraints}
	\index{Contraints}
	\index{Raspberry Pi}
	GS will run on the hardware chosen by the avionics team at the beginning of the project.
	At a minimum, this hardware will be a Raspberry Pi 3 model B, which has a 1.2 GHz quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 processor
	with 1 GB of SDRAM memory.

	\subsection{Software system attributes}

	\subsubsection{Reliability}
	\index{Reliability}
	In the event a GS process dies, a new process should begin and continue operation in under five seconds.

	\subsubsection{Robustness}
	\index{Robustness}
	If GS receives corrupted or otherwise incorrectly formatted telemetry, it should not crash.
	Additionally, the users should not be able to crash GS from the web interface.

	\subsubsection{Accuracy}
	\index{Accuracy}
	GS should not introduce any errors in the telemetry it recieves.
	Data should be logged and displayed with 100\% accuracy.
